I have written a [Shiny web app](https://bbwieland.shinyapps.io/DraftVisualization/) for exploring the data included here on every NBA draft selection dating back to 1990. It contains tools for viewing all NBA players drafted from a specific college, comparing two different colleges to one another by various statistics, or creating leaderboards for various NBA total statistics. 

Some sample questions that can be answered by the app in just a few clicks:

- How many NBA players drafted from Syracuse averaged 10 points per game in their NBA careers (the answer is 4: Carmelo Anthony, Derrick Coleman, Billy Owens, and Jerami Grant)

- Which Oklahoma State draftee averages the most career assists per game? (it's Marcus Smart, with 4.3)

- Has Florida State or Wake Forest produced more NBA players? (Florida State has produced 24 draftees, while Wake Forest has produced just 11).

- On the other hand... could we make a bar graph to visualize whether Wake Forest or Florida State draftees have played more NBA games? (Wake Forest, thanks to Tim Duncan and Chris Paul, holds a small lead in that department).

- What if we wanted to generate a table of the 20 colleges that have produced the most NBA players? 

- And what if we wanted to turn that table into a Pareto chart?
